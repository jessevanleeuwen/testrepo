## 2. Getting Started with QAFE

### 2.1 Setting up the Development Environment
QAFE Development is done in Eclipse. For the purpose of having a quickstart, weâ€™ve provided an installer which installs Eclipse (Based on Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse, OEPE 12, based on Eclipse 4.3) with all the necessary plug-ins. This installers are to be found on http://www.qafe.com/download


#### 2.1.1 Hardware requirements

To run QAFE the hardware requirements depends significantly on the number of users, applications expected and on the maximum number of required concurrent requests that the system will experience during peak hours. In addition, more CPU power, HD or memory will be needed as more QAFE components are added to the system configuration.
